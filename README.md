Estimation Software and Figure files for Uncovering modeling feature of viral replication dynamics

Included here is the parameter estimation framework developed for the manscript "Uncovering essential modeling features of viral replication dynamics from
single-cell virology experiments". The R package (kinda) is called Spide (Single-cell Population Infection Dynamics Estimation).
