Description: Aims to estimate parameters of a model from high throughput single cell virology experiments. This program makes use of a model described in: 
    Schulte,  M.  B.,  Draghi,  J.  A.,  Plotkin,  J.  B.,  and  Andino,  R.  (2015).   Experimentally guided models reveal replication principles that shape the mutation distribution of RNA viruses.eLife, 4:e03753. 
    This model is fit to data described in:
    Liu, W., Caglar, M. U., Mao, Z., Woodman, A., Arnold, J. J., Wilke, C. O., and Cameron,C. E. (2019). More than efficacy revealed by single-cell analysis of antiviral therapeutics.Science Advances, 5:eaax4761
    The code in this sudo-package (sudo because it will not be release on CRAN) was developed for a manuscript that is currently being drafted.  
    The parameter space of this model is fairly large, so to speed convergence a GA is first applied (first_round_GA.R), then an ABC is run for many iterations (trueABC.R). 
    This project was developed on a unix based platform and makes use parallelization methods which do not work on a windows platform.
